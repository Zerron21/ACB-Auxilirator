# ACB-Auxilirator
A poorly written script that automates creating the needed .acb and .awb files needed in Aemulus Mod Manager for music modding.

## Dependencies
* Place BGM files in Original\Persona 5 Royal (PS4)\sound\ for the PS4 versions if none exist by default.

A copy of [SonicAudioTools](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds/SonicAudioTools/) is included as a dependency for extracting BGM files, I couldn't find a way around it.
